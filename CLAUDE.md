## Architecture

This is a Go (1.23) repository of LeetCode and algorithmic problem solutions, organized by technique.

**Top-level packages:**
- `golang/` — LeetCode solutions grouped by algorithm category: `array`, `backtracking`, `binary_search`, `divide_and_conquer`, `dynamic_programming`, `graph`, `greedy`, `tree`, `tree_map`, `two_pointers`, `heap`, `hashmap`, `prefix_sum`, `prefix_tree`, `linked_list`, `stack_queue`, `recursion`, `memoization`, `bit_manipulation`, `math`, `design`, `api_design`, `oo_design`, `solid_coding`, `interview`. Also holds two non-category subpackages: `golang/types/` (shared LeetCode node definitions — `ListNode`, `TreeNode`, `Node` for graphs, `Interval`) and `golang/utils/` (test helpers for constructing/comparing linked lists, trees, and graphs, plus standalone Go-pattern demo files)
- `golang_containers/` (package `containers`) — custom data structure implementations used across problems: heap, LRU cache, min-max stack, red-black treemap, queue, stack, hit counter
- `golang_concurrency/` (package `concurrency`) — Go concurrency patterns: channels, fan-in/out, lock-free stack/queue/counter, mutex patterns, select patterns. Most patterns live as `Example*` functions in plain `.go` files (not `_test.go`) for narrative documentation — `go test` does **not** execute these (Example funcs only run when declared in a `_test.go` file); actual assertions live in the sibling `_test.go` files (e.g. `channels_test.go`), which don't yet cover every pattern
- `fixtures/` — static test data files (e.g. `file.txt`, the input loaded by `golang/interview/affirm_spreadsheet.go`)
- `system_design/` — written system design solutions/notes (e.g. URL shortener, autopay, hotel booking, sharding, feed generation), not part of the Go module
- `notes/project_rules/` — interview-prep "project rules" prompts (behavioral, coding/DSA, system design mock-interview instructions) used to configure Claude Code sessions for interview practice; unrelated to the Go source
- `vibe_coding/` — scratch/sandbox project scaffold (currently just a `.claude/settings.json`)

**`golang/graph` sub-packages:**
- `BFS/` — BFS on graphs and grids
- `Bellman_Ford/` — Bellman-Ford SSSP; handles negative weights and detects negative cycles; standard adjacency-list signature `graph [][][2]int`
- `DFS/` — DFS traversal patterns
- `Dijkstra/` — Dijkstra with a generic `Heap[T]` (see `generic_heap.go`); adjacency-list signature `graph [][][2]int, src int`; also covers LC 787, 743, 1631, 1514, 499, 505
- `bidirectional_BFS/` — meet-in-the-middle BFS
- `multi_source/` — multi-source BFS (e.g. rotting oranges, 01-matrix)
- `topological_sort/` — Kahn's algorithm and DFS-based topo sort
- `union_find/` — Union-Find with path compression

**Import conventions:**
- Packages that use `types` use a dot import: `. "gocode/golang/types"` so `ListNode`, `TreeNode`, etc. are available unqualified
- The module is named `gocode` (see `go.mod`)

**Testing:**
- All tests use `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert`
- Test functions are co-located with implementation files in the same package (no separate `_test` packages)
- `golang/utils/` provides helpers like `CreateLinkedList`, `VerifyLinkedLists`, and `GraphsEqual` for test setup
- Exception to the split-file norm: `golang/utils/`'s Go-pattern demos and `golang/oo_design/`'s GoF-pattern files (`facade_test.go`, `adapter_test.go`, `mediator_test.go`, `decorator_test.go`, `composite_test.go`) combine implementation + `Test_` functions in one `_test.go` file with no separate non-test source — each file is a self-contained, runnable demonstration of a single concept

**Naming conventions:**
- Functions suffixed with `Claude` (e.g. `asteroidCollisionClaude`) are alternative implementations of the same problem — a different algorithm or data structure approach, not a replacement
- Functions suffixed with `Naive` are brute-force or O(n²) baselines kept for comparison

**Design patterns (`golang/oo_design/`):** see [golang/oo_design/README.md](golang/oo_design/README.md) for the full catalogue of which of the 23 classic GoF patterns (Creational/Structural/Behavioral) are implemented here vs. not yet. `affirm_card_game.go`, `affirm_filter_match.go`, `brex_stervo_game.go` (and their test pairs) in the same package are unrelated, company-specific mock-interview OO-design problems, not named GoF patterns.

## Root README (`README.md`)

A manually-maintained index table (Problem Tag | Problem Name | LeetCode Link | Go Source | Python Source) of every solved problem, linked to the exact file and line. It is not auto-generated by any script or workflow — when adding a new solution, add a corresponding row (grouped under its existing tag section, or a new one if the tag doesn't exist yet).

## Claude Code configuration

- `.claude/agents/leetcode-reviewer.md` — subagent that reviews Go LeetCode solutions for correctness, edge cases, complexity, and idiom; invoke proactively after writing/modifying a solution
- `.claude/skills/` — `review-code`, `review-naming`, `summarize-changes`, `scoping` (interactive problem-scoping with the user — runs in the main session, grounds requirements in the codebase, produces a signed-off brief per [docs/brief-spec.md](docs/brief-spec.md) that feeds the loops), `design-loop` (entry point for the design-review loop: `research-investigator` authors, `design-bar-raiser` challenges, protocol in [docs/design-review-loop-agent-team-prompt.md](docs/design-review-loop-agent-team-prompt.md)), `pr-loop` (entry point for the PR loop: `coding-expert` implements, `code-bar-raiser` reviews, protocol in [docs/pr-loop-agent-team-prompt.md](docs/pr-loop-agent-team-prompt.md), contract in [docs/pr-spec.md](docs/pr-spec.md)), and `agent-factory` (process for creating new subagents and agent-team loops) project-specific skills

## Spaced-repetition practice (`spaced_repetition/`)

Daily LeetCode practice scheduler (Python, stdlib only; not part of the Go module). `problems.json` holds the 165-problem set (Grind 75/169 + Blind 75, bit-manipulation excluded); `state.json` tracks SM-2 review state. At 3 PM PT, a GitHub Actions workflow (`daily-leetcode.yml`) opens a new dated "Daily LeetCode YYYY-MM-DD" issue with the day's plan (auto-closing the previous day's issue), and `log-solve.yml` logs solves from the user's comments on that issue (commenting still works on closed issues); both commit `state.json` under the repo owner's identity, so `git pull` before touching state and `git push` after logging locally. When the user reports solving a problem (e.g. "solved 200 good"), run `python3 spaced_repetition/sr.py log <id> <again|hard|good|easy>` (synonyms in `GRADE_ALIASES` also accepted; the grade is attempt performance, not LeetCode difficulty). See [spaced_repetition/README.md](spaced_repetition/README.md).

## Python sub-project

`python/` is a parallel Python LeetCode repository with its own virtualenv and `CLAUDE.md`. It is completely independent of the Go module — do not mix imports or test commands.

- See [python/CLAUDE.md](python/CLAUDE.md) for setup, commands, and conventions specific to that sub-project.
- Python packages mirror the Go structure: `array`, `backtracking`, `binary_search`, `dynamic_programming`, `graph`, `hashmap`, `heap`, `interview`, `prefix_sum`, `solid_coding`, `stack_queue`, `tree`, `two_pointers`; shared types live in `common/`.

## Rust sub-project

`rust/` is a small scratch Cargo project (`tokio_hello_world`) for practicing async Rust with Tokio — independent of the Go module, with its own `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`. `cargo run` prints a greeting via a task spawned with `tokio::spawn`; `cargo test` runs the async tests in `src/tests.rs`, which use `#[tokio::test(start_paused = true)]` (the `test-util` dev-dependency feature) to fast-forward simulated time instead of actually sleeping.

## LeetCode conventions

- Strictly follow the provided function signature — do not change return types or parameters
- Assume input constraints are met; do not add extra validation unless the problem specifies it
- Prefer runtime optimization over memory when there is no explicit space constraint
- Add helper functions only when genuinely necessary; keep solutions self-contained
- Think through edge cases and T/S complexity before writing code

**Block comments:** when commenting out multiple lines, use a `/** ... */` block with every line prefixed by `* ` (GoLand-style), not `//` per line. Example:
```go
/**
 * s = "abba"
 * wordDict = ["ab", "a", "abb"]
 * Trace:
 * i=1: "a" matches, freq["a"]-- → 0, dp[1]=true
 */
```
